Task Description: You are given a problem description and a question. The task is to: 
1) define all the predicates in the problem
2) parse the problem into logic rules based on the defined predicates. Make sure to identify compound predicates and translated them using "or". Please note that conditional statement containing "if" is not considered as rules with compound predicates.
3) write all the facts mentioned in the problem
4) parse the question into the logic form

Below is an example:
Problem:
Anne is quiet. Erin is furry. Erin is green. Fiona is furry. Fiona is quiet. Fiona is red. Fiona is rough. Fiona is white. Harry is furry. Harry is quiet. Harry is white. Young people are furry. If Anne is quiet then Anne is red. Young, green people are rough. If someone is green then they are white. If someone is furry and quiet then they are white. If someone is young and white then they are rough. All red people are young.
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? Anne is white.
###
Predicates:
Quiet($x, bool) ::: Is x quiet?
Furry($x, bool) ::: Is x furry?
Green($x, bool) ::: Is x green?
Red($x, bool) ::: Is x red?
Rough($x, bool) ::: Is x rough?
White($x, bool) ::: Is x white?
Young($x, bool) ::: Is x young?
Facts:
Quite(Anne, True) ::: Anne is quiet.
Furry(Erin, True) ::: Erin is furry.
Green(Erin, True) ::: Erin is green.
Furry(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is furry.
Quite(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is quiet.
Red(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is red.
Rough(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is rough.
White(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is white.
Furry(Harry, True) ::: Harry is furry.
Quite(Harry, True) ::: Harry is quiet.
White(Harry, True) ::: Harry is white.

Rules:
Young($x, True) >>> Furry($x, True) ::: Young people are furry.
Red($x, True) >>> Young($x, True) ::: All red people are young.

Conditional rules:
Quite(Anne, True) >>> Red($x, True) ::: If Anne is quiet then Anne is red.
Green($x, True) >>> White($x, True) ::: If someone is green then they are white.
Furry($x, True) && Quite($x, True) >>> White($x, True) ::: If someone is furry and quiet then they are white.
Young($x, True) && White($x, True) >>> Rough($x, True) ::: If someone is young and white then they are rough.

Rules with Compound predicates by comma:
Young($x, True) || Green($x, True) >>> Rough($x, True) ::: Young, green people are rough.

Query:
White(Anne, True) ::: Anne is white.

Below is an example:
Problem:
Charlie is furry. Charlie is green. Charlie is white. Dave is blue. Dave is cold. Gary is cold. Gary is rough. Harry is blue. Harry is furry. Harry is rough. Harry is white. Nice, cold people are green. Rough people are green. Green people are blue. If someone is blue then they are nice. Furry, green people are rough. Green, nice people are furry. White people are nice. Cold people are blue. All rough, nice people are white.

Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? Dave is not furry.

###
Predicates:
Furry($x, bool) ::: Is x furry?
Green($x, bool) ::: Is x green?
White($x, bool) ::: Is x white?
Blue($x, bool) ::: Is x blue?
Cold($x, bool) ::: Is x cold?
Rough($x, bool) ::: Is x rough?
Nice($x, bool) ::: Is x nice?

Facts:
Furry(Charlie, True) ::: Charlie is furry.
Green(Charlie, True) ::: Charlie is green.
White(Charlie, True) ::: Charlie is white.
Blue(Dave, True) ::: Dave is blue.
Cold(Dave, True) ::: Dave is cold.
Cold(Gary, True) ::: Gary is cold.
Rough(Gary, True) ::: Gary is rough.
Blue(Harry, True) ::: Harry is blue.
Furry(Harry, True) ::: Harry is furry.
Rough(Harry, True) ::: Harry is rough.
White(Harry, True) ::: Harry is white.
Green(Nice, True) ::: Nice, cold people are green.
Green(Rough, True) ::: Rough people are green.
Blue(Green, True) ::: Green people are blue.

Rules:
White($x, True) >>> Nice($x, True) ::: White people are nice.
Cold($x, True) >>> Blue($x, True) ::: Cold people are blue.

Conditional rules:
Blue($x, True) >>> Nice($x, True) ::: If someone is blue then they are nice.


Rules with compound predicates by comma:
Furry($x, True) || Green($x, True) >>> Rough($x, True) ::: Furry, green people are rough.
Green($x, True) || Nice($x, True) >>> Furry($x, True) ::: Green, nice people are furry.
Rough($x, True) || Nice($x, True) >>> White($x, True) ::: All rough, nice people are white

Query:
Furry(Dave, False) ::: Dave is not furry.

-----
Please carefully and fully understand this important requirement before translation:
For compound predicates (statements involving multiple properties) by ",", make sure you used "or" to connect them.
For example, translate "Furry, round things are big" and "All Furry, round things are big" should be translated to "Furry($x, True) || Round($x, True) >>> Big($x, True)"
Please note that for conditional statement containing "if" is not rules with compound predicates. For instance,
