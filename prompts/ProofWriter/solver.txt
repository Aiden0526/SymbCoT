Based on the premises, question, can you execute each step by selecting relevant premises and make inference based on first-order-logic inference rules to solve the question?
-----
The first-order-logic inference rules include but are not limited to: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Generalization, Specialization, Conjunction, Elimination, Transitivity, Proof By Division Into Cases, Contradiction Rule, and etc.
-----
The definition of the three options are:
True: A statement is "true" if it necessarily follows from the given premises using logical rules.
False: A statement is "false" if it is contradicted by the premises or its negation is logically inferred from them.
Unknown: A statement is "unknown" if there is insufficient information in the premises to determine its truth value conclusively.
-----
Please solve the question step by step. During each step, please indicate what first-order logic inference rules you used. Besides, show the inference process by the logical operators including but not limited to: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence). You can combine natural language and logical operators when doing inference.
Please also highlight the final answer as "Final answer: {true/false/unknown}"

Below is an example:
Predicates:
Blue($x, bool) ::: Is x blue?
Young($x, bool) ::: Is x young?
Cold($x, bool) ::: Is x cold?
Furry($x, bool) ::: Is x furry?
Kind($x, bool) ::: Is x kind?
Red($x, bool) ::: Is x red?
Nice($x, bool) ::: Is x nice?

Facts:
Blue(Anne, True) ::: Anne is blue.
Young(Anne, True) ::: Anne is young.
Cold(Dave, True) ::: Dave is cold.
Furry(Dave, True) ::: Dave is furry.
Kind(Erin, True) ::: Erin is kind.
Red(Erin, True) ::: Erin is red.
Blue(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is blue.
Kind(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is kind.
Red(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is red.
Young(Fiona, True) ::: Fiona is young.

Rules:
Furry(Dave, True) && Cold(Dave, True) >>> Young(Dave, True) ::: If Dave is furry and Dave is cold then Dave is young.
Blue($x, True) >>> Young($x, True) ::: If Anne is blue then Anne is young.
Furry($x, True) >>> Young($x, True) ::: If Anne is furry then Anne is young.
Young($x, True) >>> Kind($x, True) ::: If someone is young then they are kind.

Rules with compound predicates by comma:
Nice($x, True) || Cold($x, True) >>> Red($x, True) ::: All nice, cold people are red.
Red($x, True) || Young($x, True) >>> Blue($x, True) ::: Red, young people are blue.
Kind($x, True) || Cold($x, True) >>> Nice($x, True) ::: All kind, cold people are nice.

Query:
Nice(Dave, False) ::: Dave is not nice.

Execution:
We would start with the conclusion and work backward, looking for relevant rules and facts that can determine the truth value of the conclusion.

Thank you for the clarification. Let's revise the process, particularly specifying the "or" condition in the rule Kind($x, True) || Cold($x, True) → Nice($x, True) and how it affects the inference:

**Step 1: Identify the Goal**
- Goal: Determine whether "Nice(Dave, False)".
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Problem statement setup).

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Rules that can infer 'Nice($x, _)**
- Relevant Rule: Kind($x, True) || Cold($x, True) → Nice($x, True). This means either Kind($x, True) or Cold($x, True) being true will lead to Nice($x, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Specific rule identification focusing on conclusion structure).

**Step 3: Identify Relevant Rules/Facts that can infer 'Kind($x, True)' or 'Cold($x, True)'**
- Relevant Fact: Cold(Dave, True) ::: Dave is cold.
- Relevant Rule: Young($x, True) → Kind($x, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Rule and fact identification for specific predicate structure).

**Step 4: Identify Facts/Rules that can infer 'Young($x, True)'**
- Relevant Fact: Furry(Dave, True) ::: Dave is furry.
- Relevant Rule: Furry($x, True) && Cold($x, True) → Young($x, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Fact and rule identification).

**Step 5: Combine Steps 2, 3, 4**
- From Cold(Dave, True) (direct fact), we can already infer Nice(Dave, True) using Modus Ponens based on the rule Kind($x, True) || Cold($x, True) → Nice($x, True), as Cold(Dave, True) satisfies one of the conditions in the "or" statement.
- It is unnecessary to assess Young(Dave, True) and Kind(Dave, True) further since Cold(Dave, True) alone is sufficient to infer Nice(Dave, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: Modus Ponens.

**Step 6: Conclude**
- Conclusion: Nice(Dave, True) is true based on the derived conclusions.
- The statement "Nice(Dave, False)" is contradicted by the derived conclusion "Nice(Dave, True)".
- First-order logic inference rule: Contradiction Rule.

Final answer: {false}

Execution:
To solve the question "Sees(squirrel, cow, False) ::: The squirrel does not see the cow," let's use the step-by-step first-order logic inference approach:

**Step 1: Identify the Goal**
- Goal: Determine whether "Sees(squirrel, cow, False)".
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Problem statement setup).

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Rules that can infer 'Sees(squirrel, cow, _)' or 'Sees($x, cow, True)'**
- Relevant Rule: Likes($x, squirrel, True) && Needs($x, squirrel, True) → Sees(squirrel, cow, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Specific rule identification focusing on conclusion structure).

**Step 3: Identify Relevant Rules that can infer 'Likes($x, squirrel, True)' and 'Needs($x, squirrel, True)'**
- Relevant Rule: Needs($x, cow, True) && Needs($x, squirrel, True) → Likes($x, squirrel, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Rule identification for specific predicate structure).

**Step 4: Identify Facts/Rules that can infer 'Needs($x, cow, True)' and 'Needs($x, squirrel, True)'**
- Relevant Fact: Needs(bald_eagle, cow, True) ::: The bald eagle needs the cow.
- Relevant Fact: Needs(bald_eagle, squirrel, True) ::: The bald eagle needs the squirrel.
- Relevant Fact: Needs(lion, squirrel, True) ::: The lion needs the squirrel.
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Fact identification).

**Step 5: Combine Steps 2, 3, 4**
- From Needs(bald_eagle, cow, True) and Needs(bald_eagle, squirrel, True), infer Likes(bald_eagle, squirrel, True) using Modus Ponens based on the rule Needs($x, cow, True) && Needs($x, squirrel, True) → Likes($x, squirrel, True).
- Then, from Likes(bald_eagle, squirrel, True) and Needs(bald_eagle, squirrel, True), infer Sees(squirrel, cow, True) using Modus Ponens based on the rule Likes($x, squirrel, True) && Needs($x, squirrel, True) → Sees(squirrel, cow, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: Modus Ponens (applied twice).

**Step 6: Conclude**
- Conclusion: Sees(squirrel, cow, True) is true based on the derived conclusions.
- The statement "Sees(squirrel, cow, False)" is contradicted by the derived conclusion "Sees(squirrel, cow, True)".
- First-order logic inference rule: Contradiction Rule.

Final answer: {false}

Below is an example:

Predicates:\nGreen($x, bool) ::: Is x green?\nLikes($x, $y, bool) ::: Does x like y?\nVisits($x, $y, bool) ::: Does x visit y?\nYoung($x, bool) ::: Is x young?\nSees($x, $y, bool) ::: Does x see y?\nRound($x, bool) ::: Is x round?\nBig($x, bool) ::: Is x big?\nCold($x, bool) ::: Is x cold?\n\nFacts:\nGreen(bear, True) ::: The bear is green.\nLikes(bear, cat, True) ::: The bear likes the cat.\nLikes(bear, dog, True) ::: The bear likes the dog.\nVisits(bear, dog, True) ::: The bear visits the dog.\nYoung(cat, True) ::: The cat is young.\nSees(cat, bear, True) ::: The cat sees the bear.\nSees(cat, dog, True) ::: The cat sees the dog.\nVisits(cat, bear, True) ::: The cat visits the bear.\nVisits(cat, mouse, True) ::: The cat visits the mouse.\nRound(dog, True) ::: The dog is round.\nLikes(dog, bear, True) ::: The dog likes the bear.\nLikes(dog, mouse, True) ::: The dog likes the mouse.\nVisits(dog, mouse, True) ::: The dog visits the mouse.\nBig(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is big.\nCold(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is cold.\nRound(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is round.\n\nRules:\nVisits($x, mouse, True) && Visits(mouse, dog, True) >>> Cold($x, True) ::: If something visits the mouse and the mouse visits the dog then it is cold.\nLikes($x, cat, True) >>> Visits($x, dog, True) ::: If something likes the cat then it visits the dog.\nCold($x, True) >>> Likes($x, cat, True) ::: If something is cold then it likes the cat.\nGreen($x, True) >>> Sees($x, dog, True) ::: If something is green then it sees the dog.\nLikes($x, mouse, True) >>> Sees($x, cat, True) ::: If something likes the mouse then it sees the cat.\nGreen($x, True) && Cold($x, True) >>> Likes($x, cat, True) ::: If something is green and cold then it likes the cat.\nBig($x, True) && Visits($x, bear, True) >>> Green(bear, True) ::: If something is big and it visits the bear then the bear is green.\n\nQuestion:\nVisits(mouse, dog, True) ::: The mouse visits the dog.

Execution:
Understood. The requirement is to iteratively identify all relevant rules that could potentially be used to infer each step in the logical chain, focusing on the structure of the predicates and not specifying the subject unless there is direct information. Let's re-execute the steps with this approach:

**Step 1: Identify the Goal**
- Goal: Determine whether "Visits(mouse, dog, True)".
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (This is a problem statement setup).

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Rules that can infer 'Visits($x, dog, True)'**
- Relevant Rule: Likes($x, cat, True) → Visits($x, dog, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Specific rule identification focusing on conclusion structure).

**Step 3: Identify Relevant Rules that can infer 'Likes($x, cat, True)'**
- No direct fact stating "Likes(mouse, cat, True)".
- Relevant Rule: Cold($x, True) → Likes($x, cat, True).
- Relevant Rule: Green($x, True) && Cold($x, True) → Likes($x, cat, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Rule identification for specific predicate structure).

**Step 4: Identify Facts/Rules that can infer 'Cold($x, True)' or 'Green($x, True) && Cold($x, True)'**
- Relevant Fact: Cold(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is cold.
- There is no direct information about "Green(mouse, True)".
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Fact identification).

**Step 5: Combine Steps 2, 3, 4**
- From Cold(mouse, True), infer Likes(mouse, cat, True) using Modus Ponens based on the rule Cold($x, True) → Likes($x, cat, True).
- Then, from Likes(mouse, cat, True), infer Visits(mouse, dog, True) using Modus Ponens based on the rule Likes($x, cat, True) → Visits($x, dog, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: Modus Ponens (applied twice).

**Step 6: Conclude**
- Conclusion: Visits(mouse, dog, True) is true based on the derived conclusions.
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Conclusion based on previous inferences).

Final answer: {true}

Below is an example:
Context:
Predicates:\nYoung($x, bool) ::: Is x young?\nVisits($x, $y, bool) ::: Does x visit y?\nCold($x, bool) ::: Is x cold?\nLikes($x, $y, bool) ::: Does x like y?\nNeeds($x, $y, bool) ::: Does x need y?\nRed($x, bool) ::: Is x red?\nBlue($x, bool) ::: Is x blue?\nNice($x, bool) ::: Is x nice?\n\nFacts:\nYoung(cat, True) ::: The cat is young.\nVisits(cat, mouse, True) ::: The cat visits the mouse.\nCold(cow, True) ::: The cow is cold.\nLikes(cow, lion, True) ::: The cow likes the lion.\nCold(lion, True) ::: The lion is cold.\nLikes(lion, cat, True) ::: The lion likes the cat.\nNeeds(lion, mouse, True) ::: The lion needs the mouse.\nVisits(lion, mouse, True) ::: The lion visits the mouse.\nCold(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is cold.\nRed(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is red.\nYoung(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is young.\nLikes(mouse, cat, True) ::: The mouse likes the cat.\nNeeds(mouse, cat, True) ::: The mouse needs the cat.\nNeeds(mouse, cow, True) ::: The mouse needs the cow.\n\nRules:\nNeeds($x, cat, True) && Red(cat, True) >>> Blue($x, True) ::: If something needs the cat and the cat is red then it is blue.\nBlue($x, True) >>> Red($x, True) ::: Blue things are red.\nLikes($x, mouse, True) && Likes(mouse, cat, True) >>> Blue(cat, True) ::: If something likes the mouse and the mouse likes the cat then the cat is blue.\nCold($x, True) && Red($x, True) >>> Likes($x, mouse, True) ::: If something is cold and red then it likes the mouse.\nNeeds($x, cow, True) && Cold($x, True) >>> Young($x, True) ::: If something needs the cow and it is cold then it is young.\nNice($x, True) >>> Visits($x, lion, True) ::: If something is nice then it visits the lion.\nNeeds($x, lion, True) >>> Likes($x, cat, True) ::: If something needs the lion then it likes the cat.\nVisits($x, cat, True) && Likes($x, lion, True) >>> Blue(cat, True) ::: If something visits the cat and it likes the lion then the cat is blue.\nCold($x, True) && Blue($x, True) >>> Needs($x, lion, True) ::: If something is cold and blue then it needs the lion.\n\nQuestion:\nBlue(cat, True) ::: The cat is blue.

Execution:

**Step 1: Identify the Goal**
- Goal: Determine whether "Blue(cat, True)".
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Problem statement setup).

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Rules that can infer 'Blue(cat, True)'**
- Rule 1: Needs($x, cat, True) && Red(cat, True) → Blue($x, True).
- Rule 2: Blue($x, True) → Red($x, True).
- Rule 3: Likes($x, mouse, True) && Likes(mouse, cat, True) → Blue(cat, True).
- Rule 4: Visits($x, cat, True) && Likes($x, lion, True) → Blue(cat, True).
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Specific rule identification focusing on conclusion structure).

**Step 3: Evaluate Rule 1**
- For Rule 1, we need to check if any $x needs the cat and if the cat is red.
- Relevant Fact for Rule 1: Needs(mouse, cat, True) ::: The mouse needs the cat.
- However, there is no information about "Red(cat, True)".
- We cannot apply Rule 1 due to lack of information about "Red(cat, True)".

**Step 4: Evaluate Rule 3**
- For Rule 3, we need to check if any $x likes the mouse and if the mouse likes the cat.
- Relevant Fact for Rule 3: Likes(mouse, cat, True) ::: The mouse likes the cat.
- We need to determine if any $x likes the mouse.

**Step 5: Identify Relevant Facts/Rules that can infer 'Likes($x, mouse, True)'**
- Relevant Rule for "Likes($x, mouse, True)": Cold($x, True) && Red($x, True) → Likes($x, mouse, True).
- We need to find entities that are both cold and red to apply this rule.

**Step 6: Assess Relevant Facts for 'Cold($x, True)' and 'Red($x, True)'**
- Relevant Fact: Cold(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is cold.
- Relevant Fact: Red(mouse, True) ::: The mouse is red.
- From Cold(mouse, True) and Red(mouse, True), we can infer Likes(mouse, mouse, True) using Modus Ponens.

**Step 7: Apply Rule 3**
- From Likes(mouse, mouse, True) and Likes(mouse, cat, True), we can infer Blue(cat, True) using Modus Ponens based on Rule 3.
- First-order logic inference rule: Modus Ponens.

**Step 8: Conclude**
- Conclusion: Blue(cat, True) is true based on the derived conclusions.
- First-order logic inference rule: N/A (Conclusion based on previous inferences).

Below are the premises and questions you need to solve:
-----
Plan:
[[PLAN]]

Context:
[[CONTEXT]]
-----

Execution requirements: 
1. Please carefully execute step by step and solve the question given the above requirements and information. Please clearly indicate whether the question is true, false or unknown using square bracket {true/false/unknown}!!! The answer will only be either true, false or unknown.
2. Please notes that if an assumption is semantically equivalent to context or information inferred from the context, it should be seen as a valid assumption. For example, "X sees X" can be interpreted as "X sees itself" since they are semantically equivalent.
3. Make sure you pay attention to identify the "Rules with compound predicates". Two predicates seperated by comma should be interpreted as "or". For instance, for "Nice($x, True) || Cold($x, True) >>> Red($x, True) ::: All nice, cold people are red", it means Nice($x, True) or Cold($x, True)>>> Red($x, True). So that either Nice($x, True) or Cold($x, True) will lead to Red($x, True).
4. Please pay attention when substituting facts in to rules. For example, if we have a fact "Chases(Cat, Tiger, True)" and a rule "Chases($x, Cat, True) >>> Sees($x, Dog, True)", we cannot infer "Sees(Tiger, Dog, True)" because "Chases(Cat, Tiger, True)" means Cat chases tiger but the rule "Chases($x, Cat, True)" means X chases cat. You need to pay attention to the order of predicates inside the rules.
5. When identify relevant rules that could potentially be used to infer the truth value of the conclusion, focus on the predicate structure in the conclusion and look for matching rules and avoid specifying subjects unless there is direct information. For example, if the conclusion is 'Sees(squirrel, cow, False)', you should find relevant rules that can lead to this conclusion and it will be 'Sees($x, cow, True)' or 'Sees($s, cow, False)' in this case unless there is direct information that can infer 'Sees(squirrel, cow, _)'.
