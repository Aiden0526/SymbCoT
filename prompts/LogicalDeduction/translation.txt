Task Description: You are given a problem description. The task is to parse the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, defining the domain, variables, and constraints.

Below is an example:
Problem:
The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a station wagon, a convertible, and a minivan. The station wagon is the oldest. The minivan is newer than the convertible.
Question:
Which of the following is true?
Options:
A) The station wagon is the second-newest.
B) The convertible is the second-newest.
C) The minivan is the second-newest.
###
Domain:
1: oldest
3: newest
Variables:
station_wagon [IN] [1, 2, 3]
convertible [IN] [1, 2, 3]
minivan [IN] [1, 2, 3]
Constraints:
station_wagon == 1 ::: The station wagon is the oldest.
minivan > convertible ::: The minivan is newer than the convertible.
AllDifferentConstraint([station_wagon, convertible, minivan]) ::: All vehicles have different values.
Query:
A) station_wagon == 2 ::: The station wagon is the second-newest.
B) convertible == 2 ::: The convertible is the second-newest.
C) minivan == 2 ::: The minivan is the second-newest.

Problem:
The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nOn a branch, there are five birds: a quail, an owl, a raven, a falcon, and a robin. The owl is the leftmost. The robin is to the left of the raven. The quail is the rightmost. The raven is the third from the left.
Question:
Which of the following is true?
Options:
A) The quail is the rightmost.
B) The owl is the rightmost.
C) The raven is the rightmost.
D) The falcon is the rightmost.
E) The robin is the rightmost.

Domain:
1: leftmost
5: rightmost
Variables:
quail [IN] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
owl [IN] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
raven [IN] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
falcon [IN] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
robin [IN] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Constraints:
owl == 1 ::: The owl is the leftmost.
robin < raven ::: The robin is to the left of the raven.
quail == 5 ::: The quail is the rightmost.
raven == 3 ::: The raven is the third from the left.

Query:
A) quail == 5 ::: The quail is the rightmost.
B) owl == 5 ::: The owl is the rightmost.
C) raven == 5 ::: The raven is the rightmost.
D) falcon == 5 ::: The falcon is the rightmost.

Please pay attention to the domain, and make sure the value for each variable is consistent with the meaning of domain and the natural langauge. 
For instance, if the Domain: 1 (cheapest) to 7 (most expensive), and a constraint says X is the second-cheapest, then the value of X should be 2 but NOT 6 because 6 means the second-most expensive which violates the meaning natural language. In this case, the smaller value infer the cheaper the thing is. So when you do comparison to check whether a constraint is satisfied or not, make sure you correctly interpret the direction of being cheaper is smaller value but NOT higher value. In this case, if a constraint says X is cheaper than Y. If X is 3 and Y is 2, this constraint is violated becuase the domain indicates that smaller value means cheaper price and 3 being larger than 2 means X is more expensive than Y, which violates the constraint.
Please pay attention to the meaning of the domain, and make sure you interpret the direction of the value based on the domain correctly to particular cases.
