Based on the premises, question and plan, can you execute each step by selecting relevant premises and make inference based on first-order-logic inference rules to solve the question? Make sure you follow the plan.
-----
The first-order-logic inference rules include but are not limited to: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Generalization, Specialization, Conjunction, Elimination, Transitivity, Proof By Division Into Cases, Contradiction Rule, and etc.
-----
Please execute the plan step by step. During each step, please indicate what first-order logic inference rules you used. Besides, show the inference process by the logical operators including but not limited to: ⊕ (either or), ∨ (disjunction), ∧ (conjunction), → (implication), ∀ (universal), ∃ (existential), ¬ (negation), ↔ (equivalence). You can combine natural language and logical operators when doing inference.
Please also highlight the final answer as "Final answer: {true/false}"
The final answer must be either true or false
Please clearly indicate whether the question is true or false using {true/false}!!!

Question:
Sour(Max, True) ::: Max is sour.

Execution:
Let's execute the plan step by step, applying first-order logic inference rules and logical operators to determine the truth value of the statement "Sour(Max, True)".

Identify the Goal

Goal: Establish whether Max is sour (Sour(Max, True)).
Utilize Facts about Max

Fact: Yumpus(Max, True).
Inference Rule: Given Fact
Logical Process: Max is a Yumpus.
Apply Yumpus to Dumpus Rule

Rule: Yumpus($x, True) >>> Dumpus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens
Logical Process: Since Max is a Yumpus, by Modus Ponens, Max is a Dumpus (Dumpus(Max, True)).
Apply Dumpus to Wumpus Rule

Rule: Dumpus($x, True) >>> Wumpus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens
Logical Process: Since Max is a Dumpus, by Modus Ponens, Max is a Wumpus (Wumpus(Max, True)).
Apply Wumpus to Impus Rule

Rule: Wumpus($x, True) >>> Impus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens
Logical Process: Since Max is a Wumpus, by Modus Ponens, Max is an Impus (Impus(Max, True)).
Apply Impus to Tumpus Rule

Rule: Impus($x, True) >>> Tumpus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens
Logical Process: Since Max is an Impus, by Modus Ponens, Max is a Tumpus (Tumpus(Max, True)).
Evaluate Tumpus and Sour Relationship

Rule: Tumpus($x, True) >>> Sour($x, False).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens
Logical Process: Since Max is a Tumpus, by Modus Ponens, Max is not sour (Sour(Max, False)).
Contradiction with the Question

Logical Process: The conclusion Sour(Max, False) contradicts the question statement Sour(Max, True).
Conclude

Conclusion: Based on the logical deductions from the premises and rules, the statement "Sour(Max, True)" is false.
Final answer: {false}

Jompus($x, True) >>> Yumpus($x, True) ::: Each Jompus is a Yumpus.

Question in Logic Form:
Metallic(Wren, False) ::: Wren is not metallic.

Execution:
Let's execute the plan step by step, using first-order logic inference rules and logical operators:

Identify the Goal

Goal: Establish the truth value of "Metallic(Wren, False)".
Logical Framework: Determine whether Wren, as per the given predicates and facts, is not metallic.
Utilize the Fact about Wren

Fact: Tumpus(Wren, True).
Inference Rule: Existential Instantiation.
Logical Process: We instantiate the fact that Wren is a Tumpus. Tumpus(Wren, True).
Apply Rules Involving Tumpus

Rule: Tumpus($x, True) >>> Wumpus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens.
Logical Process: Since Tumpus(Wren, True), it follows that Wumpus(Wren, True).
Wumpus to Rompus

Rule: Wumpus($x, True) >>> Rompus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens.
Logical Process: Wumpus(Wren, True) implies Rompus(Wren, True).
Apply Rules Involving Rompus

Rule: Rompus($x, True) >>> Impus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens.
Logical Process: Since Rompus(Wren, True), it follows that Impus(Wren, True).
Apply Rules Involving Impus

Rule: Impus($x, True) >>> Dumpus($x, True).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens.
Logical Process: From Impus(Wren, True), it follows that Dumpus(Wren, True).
Apply Rules Involving Dumpus

Rule: Dumpus($x, True) >>> Metallic($x, False).
Inference Rule: Modus Ponens.
Logical Process: Since Dumpus(Wren, True), it follows that Metallic(Wren, False).
Conclude

Conclusion: Through logical inferences using the rules, we have established that Wren, being a Dumpus, is not metallic. Therefore, the statement "Metallic(Wren, False)" is true.
Final answer: {true}
